It is similar to VBA functions therefore first you define your name function 
that you declare it as a function in x or nore variables in this case will be in 2 variables that i have called x,y
then open {} and write what you want the function to perform


variazione_perc <- function(x,y){
  variazione_perc = (y-x)/x *100
  variazione_perc
  
}
