You have to type at least 3 characters to view suggestion.

But when there is a problem in the name (as this could contain reserved name) then it will not give any suggestion

as for example when you have

ED(1).csv as a name it will report it as

`ED(1).csv` 

in order to get this you have to type evertyhthing therefore you have to be careful as will not receive any help.
