You have to type at least 3 characters to view suggestion.

But when there is a problem in the name (as this could contain reserved name) then it will not give any suggestion if the 
character before the reserved symbol are less than three.

as for example when you have

ED(1).csv as a name first of all it will report it as

`ED(1).csv` 

and then it is a 2 characters before the parenthesis that is reserverd.

So in order to get this you have to type evertyhthing therefore you have to be careful as will not receive any help in 
completing.
