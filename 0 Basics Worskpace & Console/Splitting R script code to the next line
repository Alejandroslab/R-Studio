Sometimes it could happen that you want a line of code to go to the next line as it is quite difficult to read moving on the 
right the scrolling bar

Remember that you can do that but you cannot split paths such as 

"~/Data/Folder/Subfolder"

This cannot go to the next line as:

"~/Data/
Folder/Subfolder"

It will not work.

Paths must always be in the same line or you will get an error of 'No such file or directory"

Anywyas for example this will work:


write.table(   AAPL_ALL,     file = "~/Data/Folder/Subfolder/AAPL_ALL.csv", 
                sep = ',', row.names = F)
                
So now you got the same code in two lines
