The easiest way to manage Rprofile, RHistory commands and Rdata database in the workspace
is to use RProjects

An R Projects include all of these components when you save it. If you will activate view of hidden files you will in fact see 
Rdata and RHistory.

So just use Rproj to keep things tidy and simple.
