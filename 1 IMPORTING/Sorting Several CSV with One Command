I have 66 files csv tables that I need to sort (ascending) from the oldest entry to the newest.
Now is from the newest to the oldest.


This will sort all the files from the directory 'Data' that is located in "MyWorkingDirectory" and will paste the result of the data sorted
in the folder "DataSorted" that is another folder inside "MyWorkingDirectory".

Remember! In order to work th folder 'Data' should contain only the csv files (not other folders) otherwise it will not work


file_list=list.files(path="~/MyWorkingDirectory/Data")
no_files<-length(file_list)
i=1

for (i in 1:no_files){
  tempname<-file_list[i]
  tempdataset<-read.csv(paste("~/MyWorkingDirectory/Data",tempname,sep="/"))
  tempdataset<- tempdataset[seq(dim(tempdataset)[1],1),]
  write.csv(tempdataset,paste("~/MyWorkingDirectory/DataSorted",tempname,sep="/"))
  
}
