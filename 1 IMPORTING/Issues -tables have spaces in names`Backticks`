ISSUE WITH BACKTICKS` ` 

When in the system there are tables called like:

'New Table'
'New Table 2 Definitive'
'New Table 3 2019'

You notice that there are some spaces in their name.

This will cause an issue as if you import these table you will get the BACKTICKS ` that are a particular symbol that appears when
R cannot manage well the names

A pair of backticks is a way to refer to names or combinations of symbols that are otherwise reserved or illegal. 
Reserved are words like if are part of the language, while illegal includes non-syntactic combinations like c a t. 
These two categories, reserved and illegal, are referred to in R documentation as non-syntactic names. 

so if I import a table called 'C a t' with the space i will get this:

`C a t` 
instead of 

C a t 

this because R cannot manage spaces in that way

So the best thing to do is to rename the tables


BACKTICKS will appear even with parenthesis ( ) in files called like this (even if there is no space in the file names):

NewTable(1)

So it will get tricky to use this dataframes becausel you will not get for example suggestion when want to recall columns
It will appear something like this:
`NewTable(1)`$Price

So it's better to rename the files before importing. (In Mac just select all the files click right and 'Rename x files' and
substitute the names as you wish :))
