The separator could be an empty space and the file must be in the same folder (so it is much more easy). 
The file could be also a .txt file.

IBMSTOCK <- read.table("data.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")

SP500F<- read.table("d_sp500f_1987.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "")

# or:

Data <- read.table("dati.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
