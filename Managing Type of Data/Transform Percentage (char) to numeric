#If we have data as character like "1.5%", "15.34%" and we want to delete "%"

#This will work only on vectors.

#(I used 'matrix' in order to see the vector quickly with a click)


newcolum<- matrix(as.numeric(sub("%", "", dataframe$column,fixed=TRUE))) 

#and will get data like "1.5", "15.34"

#With this:

newcolum<- matrix(as.numeric(sub("%", "", dataframe$column,fixed=TRUE)/100)) 

#will get data like "0.015", "0.1534"
