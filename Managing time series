use chron package

TO CHANGE FROM FACTOR TO NUMERIC A TIME SERIES LIKE hh:mm:ss.

Create a vector and use chron where times is the vector with the data as hh:mm:ss

TradeTimeVec<- chron(times=IBMSTOCK$TradeTime)

then you can check that TradeTimeVec is numeric with 

is.numeric(TradeTimeVec)

To make differences among the values just use diff()

so in this case will be 

diff(TradeTimeVec)
