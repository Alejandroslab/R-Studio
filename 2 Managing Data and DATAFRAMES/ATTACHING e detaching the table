#To make more easy the code, the table 

'IBMSTOCK' is attached

attach(IBMSTOCK)

it is useful when you are going to deal only with a table in order to avoid writing 

IBMSTOCK$Price

when recalling single columns
therefore you can just type

Price 

and the column will be recalled 


to undo this operation just 'detach'

detach(IBMSTOCK)
