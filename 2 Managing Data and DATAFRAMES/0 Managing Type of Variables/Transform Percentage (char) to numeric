#If we have data as character like "1.5%", "15.34%" and we want to delete "%"



#Remember: this will work only on vectors.

#(I used 'matrix' in order to check the vector quickly with a click)


newcolumn<- matrix(as.numeric(sub("%", "", dataframe$column,fixed=TRUE)))


#And will get data like "1.5", "15.34"

#With this:

newcolumn<- matrix(as.numeric(sub("%", "", dataframe$column,fixed=TRUE))/100)


#will get data like "0.015", "0.1534"
