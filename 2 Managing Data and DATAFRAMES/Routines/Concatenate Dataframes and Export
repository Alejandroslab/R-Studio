In this case we have two dataframe to concatenate
The second one is called RECI(1).csv so R will use the backticks to recall it as this has the brackets inside the name

So first concatenate the two dataframes with rbind:

RECI_ALL<-rbind(RECI.csv, `RECI(1).csv`) 

then export:

write.table(    RECI_ALL,     file = "~/Data/RECI_ALL.csv", 
                sep = ',', row.names = F)


Remember that we don't need to create the file RECI_ALL.csv previously as the command write.table will create it for you if it does not exist
