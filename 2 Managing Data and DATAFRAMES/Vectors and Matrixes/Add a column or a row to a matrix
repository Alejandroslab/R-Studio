i <- c(1:5000)
Apple<- cbind(AAPL_Historical_Data, i)

You are adding to matrix AAPl_Historical_Data a colum called "i" that was previously defined as a vector (or column) with numeric values
from 1 to 5000


for rows:

mytable<-rbind(mytable,value_or_vector )



or

z17 <- c(1,2,3,6)
z17
z18 <- c(2,3,4,5)
z18
r_z17_z18 <- rbind(z17,z18)
r_z17_z18
c_z17_z18 <- cbind(z17,z18)
c_z17_z18
A3 <- matrix(1:8, nrow=2)
A3
A4 <- rbind(z17,A3)
A4
