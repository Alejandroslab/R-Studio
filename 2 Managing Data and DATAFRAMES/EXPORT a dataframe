#If you edited or created a dataframe, (for example after concatenate 2 or more dataframes) 
and then you want to export it to your folder:

write.table(Apple, "~/Subfolder/Apple.csv", sep = ',', row.names = F)

Rememeber! that the file that you declare as path '~/.../file.csv' could even not exist.
R WILL CREATE the file in the path you want or replace it if it still exists.

Remember! If you don't put row.names R will insert as default a column of indexes 1,2,3,.. for each row 
so if you put that as false it will not be added. 
So row.names attribute is necessary.


________

But in case you want that column just write


write.table(Apple, "~/Apple.csv", sep = ',', col.names = NA)

that is:

(DataframeToExport, "~/Subfolder/NameOfFile.csv", sep = ',', col.names =NA)



# Be careful as if you don't add the 'col.names = NA' then the names of the columns will be shifted to the left because of the
first column will be an index column

____

#another command is write.csv
write.csv(projectdataf, file="project4.csv")
