#First we define the address of the set of csv:

folder<-"~/Data/"

#Remember to put "~/" and " / " after the name of the folder in which data is included

 
# path to folder that holds multiple .csv files

file_list <- list.files(path=folder, pattern="*.csv") 

# create list of all .csv files in folder

# read in each .csv file in file_list and create a data frame with the same name as the .csv file

i=1

for (i in 1:length(file_list)){
  
  assign(file_list[i], 
         
         read.csv(paste(folder, file_list[i], sep=''))
         
  )}
