No need of additional packages because function 'order' is included in package 'base' of R.

I create a new matrix called SP500Ordered in which I sort all the values with Trade.Date (so sorting basically by the date).

SP500Ordered<-SP500[order(Trade.Date),]

It is necessary the comma because there are also other columns (Trade.Price, Volume, ecc.)

You can use also sort.list

dum<-sort.list(times)


if you want 'descending' instead of 'ascending' just type:

SP500Ordered<-SP500[order(Trade.Date, decreasing = TRUE),]
